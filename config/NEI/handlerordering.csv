# Each line in this file should either be a comment (starts with '#') or an ordering.
# Ordering lines are <handler ID>,<ordering number>.
# Handlers will be sorted in order of number ascending, so smaller numbers first.
# Any handlers that are missing from this file will be assigned to 0.
# Negative numbers are fine.
# If you delete this file, it will be regenerated with all registered handler IDs.
